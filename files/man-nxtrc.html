<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>nxtrc</B>

<B>nxtrc</B>

[-a ADDR] [-v] command 
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

NXTRC (NXT Remote Command) is a small program that allows to send various
commands to a LEGO Mindstorm NXT Brick. It uses the Bluetooth protocol through
the Bluez libraries. 
<P>

The option 
<B>-s</B>

starts a scan to find BlueTooth devices. If a BT address is given in the
command line or is in the Environment Variable BTADDR it connects to the NXT
and performs the task specified in &lt;command&gt;. The first time you connect with
a device you need to exchange a password, this task is usually done by the
Operative System BlueTooth Management (as Kbluetooth under KDE).

<H2>File Names and Patterns</H2>

<P>

On the NXT File names are of the form &quot;Name.Ext&quot; with max 15 characters for
the Name and 3 for the Extension. When asking a listing with the 
<B>-l</B>

command you can give a specific file name to see if it's on the NXT and list
its size, or a Pattern using widlcards. Due to the limitation of the NXT API
patterns are limited to the form &quot;*.ext&quot;, &quot;Name.*&quot; or &quot;*.*&quot; this last one is
the default and can be omitted.
